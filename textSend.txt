SEVERE: The web application [/new] created a ThreadLocal with key of type [java.lang.ThreadLocal] (value [java.lang.ThreadLocal@6a2db7d0]) and a value of type [com.documentum.web.env.app.AppServerEnvironment] (value [[Name = App Server Environment, Description = App Server Environment Implementation, Major Version = 0, Minor Version = 1, Author = Documentum, Portal Description = App Server, Portal Version = x.x, Environment Base Version = 1.0, Environment Service Version = 6.0, Supports Dispatch Contract = true, Supports Error Contract = true, Supports FormOperationListener Contract = false, Supports Theme Contract = true, Supports Locale Contract = true, Supports Tag Contract = false, Supports Session Contract = true, Supports SuperCredentials Contract = true, Supports Preference Contract = true, Supports Login Contract = false, Supports Render Contract = true, Supports Security Contract = true, Supports ContentTransfer Contract = true, Supports ActionPrecondition Contract = false, Supports MessageService Contract = false]]) but failed to remove it when the web application was stopped. This is very likely to create a memory leak.
